            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
            specimen book.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable

        <p class="para-third">
            Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many 
            web sites still in their infancy.

            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, 
            but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by 
            injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even 
            slightly believable.

        <p class="para-first">
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
            specimen book.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
            content of a page when looking at its layout. 
        </p>
        <p class="para-third">
            Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many 
            web sites still in their infancy.

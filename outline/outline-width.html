            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
            readable content of a page when looking at its layout.

            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.

        <p class="para-four">
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, 
            but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
            humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.

Combinator slector

Which explains the relationship between the selectors 

CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector.

 between the simple selectors we can include combinator

 3. adjacent sibling selector (+) - 
 4. general sibling selector (~)

Opacity - is a property which specifies the tranparency 
          of an element 
          It can take value between 0.0 to 1.0 
          0.1, 0.2,0.3...1.0
          The lower the value the more tranparent it is 

RGB - This is a color value 

RGBA - if you don't want to apply opacity to child elements 

A - Specifies the Opacity and a value between 
    0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque)

RGBA - RED GREEN BLUE ALPHA :rgba(red, gree, blue, alpha)

#FF SE C2 
rgb(0,0,128)
rgba(0,128,0,0.3)

Which one to USe RGB or HEX ?

It depends on choice 
No performance differences ( both work in similar manner)
if we are familiar with HTML devlopement - we will normally use Hexadecimal number 
if we are from Deginer ( Photoshop) background - rgb 
Graphic editors - will both have hexa and RGB but when it comes to copying the values hex will have single textbox 

HEX - More convenient 
    - Easy to copy 
    - easier for daily usage 

RGB - Tranparency ( opacity) 
RGBA - RGBAlpha (0,255,5, 0.3)

CSS color Module leve draft ( alpha)
8digit Hexadecimal code 

#RRGGBBAA

#00ffaa80 == rgba(0,255,170, 0.5)

#fff easier when comparing with this rgb(255,255,255)
